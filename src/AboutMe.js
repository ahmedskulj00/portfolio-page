          Hi, my name is Ahmed Å kulj. I am from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
          Currently I am studying Software Engineering at the University of
          Zenica. I started coding about two years ago, and since then I made
          over 20 different repositories, big and small. I prefer building
          frontend minimalistic apps, but I have also worked on some backend
          projects.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
